`useAuth` is a React hook that facilitates authentication from your WordPress site.

## Usage

Below is the config object for `useAuth` defined as a TypeScript type:

```ts
type UseAuthOptions = {
  /**
   * Default is "redirect". Learn more about these two strategies
   * @link https://faustjs.org/docs/auth#strategies
   */
  strategy?: 'redirect' | 'local';

  /**
   * The login page Uri. Only applicable/required when strategy is "local".
   */
  loginPageUri?: string;

  /**
   * If useAuth should automatically redirect to the login page
   * if there is no authenticated user.
   */
  shouldRedirect: boolean;
};
```

```jsx
const { isAuthenticated, redirectUri, user, login, logout } = useAuth(useAuthOptions?);
```

Below is the `useAuth` exports defined as a TypeScript type:

```ts
type UseAuth = {
  /**
   * A way to determine if a user is authenticated or not. The value is `null` by default, and then changes to a boolean once the state is determined.
   */
  isAuthenticated: boolean | null;

  /**
   * a boolean to determine the loading state of the user's authentication state.
   */
  loading: boolean;

  /**
   * The uri of the login page. This may either be a Next.js file based page or a login page on the WordPress backend based on your strategy.
   */
  loginUri: string | null;

  /**
   * The user object. Null if useAuth is still loading or there is not an authenticated user.
   */
  user: User | null;

  /**
   * A callable function to login a user from your Faust app. Accepts a parameter of either username/email, and password.
   */
  login: (usernameEmail: string, password: string) => void;

  /**
   * A callable function to logout a user from your Faust app. Accepts an optional uri parameter to redirect after logout.
   */
  logout: (redirectUri?: string) => void;
};
```
